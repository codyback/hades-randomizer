# Hades Randomizer

A simple Hades run randomizer to mix things up. 
Randomizes every option you have before a run in the game: Heat/Mirror/Keepsake/Companion/Weapon/Aspect

Simply change the options and everything will be randomized. 
Options are weighted to make the randomization a bit more fun (less likely to get bad heats options, more likely to get more fun ones like extreme measure)
However, if you feel like that makes things to easy you can turn that option off for a completely random experience.
